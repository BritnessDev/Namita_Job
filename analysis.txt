NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of cells in the maze.

============
  solveBfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(V+E) --> O(n) because the number of cells are always bigger than number of edges and vertices, due to walls

- Explanation: Traverses through the edges so E's time complexity, i.e number of edges. Every time this is recursively called the call is E-1 as the for loop iterates. Initilising initial matrices takes V time so total time complexity is O(V+E).

============
  solveDfs
============

- Worst case time complexity: O(V+E) i.e. O(n). because the number of cells is always bigger than number of edges and vertices due to walls.

- Explanation: While Q is not empty, it traverses through edges each time only once, therefore, E's time complexity (no. of edges)
indicating initial matrices takes V units of time. Thus, total time complexity is O(V+E).
